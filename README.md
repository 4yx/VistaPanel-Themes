# Welcome to VistaPanel Themes
This project contains some new themes for VistaPanel, a Web Hosting Panel created by iFastNet.

These themes include the popular PaperLantern Default Themes (except Retro) and some additional ones that were introduced at the beggining of cPanel X3 deprecation, including custom ones.

# Installation Guide
You must download the folders first and then upload them to your website. 

In case you don't want or cannot afford to do that, I have installed all the folders in our CDN, just replace mydomain.com in the code with it.

# How to use and deploy into VistaPanel
You must paste the code included below to your header and footer section of control panel adverts, which can be found from your MyOwnFreeHost panel.

The code below are just examples for a theme, you must replace "light" or whatever is there to the name of the theme you want to use.
You can find it's name written at the folder, and it is **case sensitive**.

## For Normal Themes
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://mydomain.com/light/icon_spritemap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://mydomain.com/light/styles.css">
```

## For Lite Themes
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://mydomain.com/light-lite/styles.css">
```

## For LightSpace Theme
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://mydomain.com/lightspace-blue/panel.css">
```


It will be now deployed and used in VistaPanel. Congratulations, you have just changed your theme!
