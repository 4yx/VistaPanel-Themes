# VistaPanel Customizations
Some new themes for VistaPanel of iFastNet.
These themes include the popular PaperLantern Default Themes (except Retro) and some additional ones that were introduced at the beggining of cPanel X3 deprecation.
# Installation Guide
You must download the folders first and then upload them to your website. 
In case you don't want or cannot afford to do that, I have installed all the folders in the domain vpanel.gq or vpanel.000webhostapp.com, just replace mydomain.com in the code with it.
# How to use and deploy into VistaPanel
You must paste the code included in code.html to your header and footer section of advertisement control in VistaPanel.
The code in code.html is just an example using the Light theme, you must change "light" to the theme's folder you want to use.
It will be now deployed and used in VistaPanel. Congraulations, you have just changed your theme!
