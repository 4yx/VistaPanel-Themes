# Welcome to VistaPanel Themes Site
This project contains some new themes for VistaPanel, a Web Hosting Panel created by iFastNet.<br />
These themes include the popular PaperLantern Default Themes (except Retro) and some additional ones that were introduced at the beggining of cPanel X3 deprecation.

The project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing you to do whatever you may want with the code.<br /> A contribution however is not neccesary at all, but if you could do so we would be very happy.

Happy customizing!
# Installation Guide
You must download the folders first and then upload them to your website. 

In case you don't want or cannot afford to do that, I have installed all the folders in this domain, just replace mydomain.com in the code with it.
# How to use and deploy into VistaPanel
You must paste the code included in code.html to your header and footer section of advertisement control in VistaPanel.

The code in there is just an example using the Light theme, you must change "light" to the theme's folder you want to use at your website.

It will be now deployed and used in VistaPanel. Congraulations, you have just changed your theme!
