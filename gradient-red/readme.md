Download the theme you like and upload the files to your website.

If you don't want to host the files on your server yourself or you can't host them, check the `B2` stage of this documentation.

# B2) If you can't upload the files to your hosting;
You can always use our free CDN, it's really fast :)
Our CDN's domain is `cdn.neotidev.cf`

# C) Usage on VistaPanel
Go to iFastNet reseller panel, Your Adverts -> Control Panel Advert Control -> Select your domain

Add these to both `Top adverts` and `Bottom adverts`:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.neotidev.cf/themes/reddish/icon_spritemap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.neotidev.cf/themes/reddish/styles.css">
```
(If you want, you can also change the addresses to your website. {If you've uploaded files to your host.})

# D) Final

Don't forget that you need to re-login to your cPanel. If you can't see the changes, you may need to purge your cache or try in an incognito tab.
